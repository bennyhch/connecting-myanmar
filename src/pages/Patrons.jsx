                  Read the Scholars’ stories to identify who you would like to
                  sponsor. You can also invite your friends or family to sponsor
                  the Scholar together.

                  Sign up as a Patron (Select the Scholar's name) and monthly
                  donation will be deducted throughout the commitment period.

                  Give us (1) your photo and (2) a short bio telling us about
                  yourself and your reason for becoming a Patron. This is
                  optional as we understand that you may want to stay anonymous.
                  But we also welcome you to do so as your story could inspire
                  more to sign up as a Patron!
