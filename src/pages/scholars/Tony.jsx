            Hi! Iâ€™m Tun Aye (a.k.a. Tony), an English major in Chiang Mai
            Rajabhat University.

            I know four languages/dialects - Karen (dialect in Myanmar),
            Burmese, Thai and English. People say that every language is a
            universe. In my case, learning a new language always brought me to a
            better place.
          </ParagraphWrapper>
          <ParagraphWrapper>
            When I was 10 years old, I migrated from my hometown in Karen State
            of Myanmar, to a refugee camp in Thailand. As a Karenni, I couldn't
            communicate with other residents in the camp, who spoke either
            mainstream Burmese or Thai. I bridged this painful gap by I learning
            both languages.
          </ParagraphWrapper>

            High school was where I encountered English. I was very interested
            in the subject, as I believed that good English skills were the key
            to finding a respectable job. Despite practising industriously, by
            graduation, I still lagged behind due to my poor foundation.
            However, I've decided to continue reading English in university. I
            believe that mastering English is the gateway to a better future.
          </ParagraphWrapper>
          <ParagraphWrapper>
            Given my humble background, I am constantly aware of how lucky I am
            to attend university. I hope to join a reputable company to empower
            myself. In the long run, I hope to help the many others who are less
            fortunate.
