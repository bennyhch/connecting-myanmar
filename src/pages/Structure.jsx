          <p>Connecting Myanmar completely relies on volunteers to function.</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            We look for more volunteers who share our vision of having an
            empathetic world where everyone has the equal opportunity to realise
            their potential and aspirations. A volunteer at CM can contribute in
            many ways - designing promotional materials, managing CMâ€™s social
            platforms (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn) and website, organizing
            events (e.g. BBQ party, Art Jamming gathering), devising the
            Scholarship Scheme, helping out with our annual art sale, and so
            many more!{" "}
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            If you would like to learn more about who we are and what we do, we
            encourage you to join our next gathering (to chat, eat, network -
            super casual! :D). You may fill in the form at
            https://forms.gle/UQa5F5tWVKiRwhSj7 and we will get in touch as soon
            as we can!
