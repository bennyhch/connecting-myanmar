            Street Law is an approach to bring the law to grassroots populations
            using interactive teaching methodologies. Through our Street Law
            Program, law students from Hong Kong conduct interactive classroom
            activities such as discussions, debates, role-plays, and mock trials
            etc. with students in Myanmar with the aim to translate the law to a
            language digestible by layman and the public at large.
